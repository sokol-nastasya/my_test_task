		<h2 id="first">Content</h2>
		<p>Articles in scientific journals are mostly written by active scientists such as
			students, researchers and professors instead of professional journalists. There are
			thousands of scientific journals in publication, and many more have been published at
			various points in the past (see list of scientific journals). Most journals are highly
			specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as Nature publish articles and
			scientific papers across a wide range of scientific fields. Scientific journals contain
			articles that have been peer reviewed, in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal's
			standards of quality, and scientific validity. Although scientific journals are superficially
			similar to professional magazines, they are actually quite different. Issues of a scientific
			journal are rarely read casually, as one would read a magazine. The publication of the results of
			research is an essential part of the scientific method. If they are describing experiments or
			calculations, they must supply enough details that an independent researcher could repeat the
			experiment or calculation to verify the results. Each such journal article becomes part of the
			permanent scientific record.</p>
			<br><br><br>
		<h2 id="second">Scope</h2>
		<p>Articles in scientific journals can be used in research and higher education. Scientific
			articles allow researchers to keep up to date with the developments of their field and direct their own
			research. An essential part of a scientific article is citation of earlier work. The impact of articles
			and journals is often assessed by counting citations (citation impact). Some classes are partially devoted
			to the explication of classic articles, and seminar classes can consist of the presentation by each student
			of a classic or current paper. Schoolbooks and textbooks have been written usually only on established topics,
			while the latest research and more obscure topics are only accessible through scientific articles. In a scientific
			research group or academic department it is usual for the content of current scientific journals to be discussed
			in journal clubs. Public funding bodies often require the results to be published in scientific journals. Academic
			credentials for promotion into academic ranks are established in large part by the number and impact of scientific
			articles published. Many doctoral programs allow for thesis by publication, where the candidate is required to
			publish a certain number of scientific articles.</p>

		<img src="{% static 'img/2_a.png' %}" alt="img2" width="250" style="float:right; marign:0px 20px;">
		<p>There are several types of journal articles; the exact terminology and definitions vary by field and specific
			journal, but often include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Letters (also called communications, and not to be confused with letters to the editor) are short
					descriptions of important current research findings that are usually fast-tracked for immediate
					publication because they are considered urgent.</li>
				<li>Research notes are short descriptions of current research findings that are considered
					less urgent or important than Letters.</li>
				<li>Articles are usually between five and twenty pages and are complete descriptions of
					current original research findings, but there are considerable variations between
					scientific fields and journalsâ€”80-page articles are not rare in mathematics or theoretical
					computer science.</li>
				<li>Supplemental articles contain a large volume of tabular data that is the result of current
					research and may be dozens or hundreds of pages with mostly numerical data. Some journals
					now only publish this data electronically on the Internet. Supplemental information also
					contains other voluminous material not appropriate for the main body of the article, like
					descriptions of routine procedures, derivations of equations, source code, non-essential data,
					spectra or other such miscellaneous information.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The formats of journal articles vary, but many follow the general IMRAD scheme recommended
				by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Such articles begin with an abstract,
				which is a one-to-four-paragraph summary of the paper. The introduction describes the background for
				the research including a discussion of similar research. The materials and methods or experimental
				section provides specific details of how the research was conducted. The results and discussion section
				describes the outcome and implications of the research, and the conclusion section places the research in
				context and describes avenues for further exploration.</p>
			<p>In addition to the above, some scientific journals such as Science will include a news section
				where scientific developments (often involving political issues) are described. These articles are
				often written by science journalists and not by scientists. In addition, some journals will include an
				editorial section and a section for letters to the editor. While these are articles published within a
				journal, in general they are not regarded as scientific journal articles because they have not been peer-reviewed.</p>
